## Week 1
<p>In the first class of week one, was just an introductory class into what the project was about, and how we were to set up our workstations. We had to do this all manually ourselves to simulate what it would be like in the real world coming into a company that has already up and running. We also found out all the different projects that were available for us to partake in. However, the one project I wanted to do, game development, highly sorted after, so I had to apply for it. This meant that I had to go and talk to my lecturer about becoming part of the group. So I organised a meeting via email (as when I went to see him, he was busy in a meeting), and then the next day I went and had the interview.</p>
<p>In the second class of this week, we found out what projects we would be taking part in. I was lucky enough to find myself being part of the game development group, but in a smaller, less central group. This meant that while I wasn't part of the main game development group, I was still able to be part of a game development project. I also met the people I would be working with, James Grigg (my friend) I already knew, and Nick Mulrooney. Neither James or I had worked with Nick before, so we had to go through the stages of forming a group. This was made significantly easier since everyone was pretty relaxed about everything. We just got along.</p>

*Review*
<p>In review of this week, not a lot happened. It was mostly just getting the team together, and to get a rough idea as to what we would be doing for a project. There wasn't a lot of work completed as we just tried to get to know each other.</p>


## Week 2
<p>In the first class of week two, we were introduced to the software that we would be using for our project. This was unity. It allowed us to simply create 3D games, and have them be ported onto a cellphone to be played on there. However, there was an issue of none of us ever using unity before. This became even more of an issue when unity wouldn't even let us run the basic starting out tutorials. Due to this, I began the Open Mind course but was only able to start it due to what limited time we had left.</p>
<p>In the second class of the week, I mostly focussed on finishing off the Open Mind course while helping Nick complete his version of a collection game. This wasn't a whole lot of work, it was just focussing on realising flaws in my own mindset about conflict, and viewpoints.</p>

*Review*
<p>In review of this week, unity didn't exactly go very well, to begin with. We struggled to get the tutorial going due to some permissions on the computer. Other than that though, the week went well. I was able to finish the Open Mind course, with a score of 92%. Next week I plan on attempting the collection game that Nick was working on.</p>


## Week 3
<p>In week 3, I began working on the collection game. Most of it was straight forward and easy to do, as I was just following along with the online tutorial. There wasn't anything that went wrong with this, as the tutorial is quite easy to understand. The only issue that I had was that because it was a video tutorial, I spent a lot of time sitting around just waiting to code.</p>

*Review*
<p>In review of this week, I managed to get unity working properly and to be able to get a basic game down. Nothing really went wrong, I just felt like I was wasting a lot of time during the tutorial, which could've been better spent doing something else. Next week I shall try and add my own spin on the collection game.</p>


## Week 4
<p>In the first class of week 4, I decided that I would try and make the collection game a little more my own. I decided to do this by randomizing the spawns of each of the collectables around the "world". I also made repeating different "levels", which basically just reset the map whenever the player has collected all the pickups. I plan on adding in tokens which will cause the player to lose. The idea is to have these a somewhat similar colour so that when the user encounters a situation where they are influenced by colour blindness, they two look similar. This is to show the user how difficult life is for a person that is colour blind, where they can constantly mistake one thing for something else.</p>
<p>In the second class of week 4, I started working on adding the colour blindness to the game. It seems really simple to do, all I have to do is add it to the canvas so that it will always influence the player's screen. Our lecturer gave us the idea of using the post-processing pipeline which would be a good thing for me to look into.</p>

*Review*
<p>In review of this week, I found it quite productive. Since I wasn't being held up due to the slow tutorial, I was able to go through and work at my own pace. This meant I was able to get a lot of stuff done. We, unfortunately, might be getting split up into separate  project groups, as Nick already has been. This means it's only James and I left working together. However, we can still help each other out, as we are all still working together, on somewhat similar projects.</p>
